## Who uses HSM\'s?
-   we do :grin:
-   but mostly banks and other payment processors.
-   also: Certificate Authorities (think: LetsEncrypt, Sectigo, DigiNotar)
-   In theory a website could use an HSM for its SSL certificate. In such a scenario you can store the certificates of-server. 

In short: Mostly organisations that need to prove their secrets are actually secret and need the enhanced trust that an HSM can provide.\
For us DNS-registries: We need to provide something that others can build upon, we can never be the weakest link in the chain.
