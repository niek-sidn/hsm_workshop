## HSM Formfactors
An HSM can be:
-   A networked hardware appliance like the Thales Luna
-   A locally running piece of software on a server, like [SoftHSM](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2)
-   A PCI card or USB device (e.g. YubiHSM)
-   A cloud service or cloud managed device
-   A docker/podman container (NitroKey has one: [NetHSM](https://hub.docker.com/r/nitrokey/nethsm))
    > NitroKey is not AWS Nitro

Your bankcard could be viewed as an HSM... maybe.\
If you have a modern computer or laptop, you could have a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) inside it, these have a lot in common with an HSM.
