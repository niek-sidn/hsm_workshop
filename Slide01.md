## What is an HSM?

-   HSM stands for "hardware security module", and it is an appliance
    (maybe application) specialized in doing cryptographic operations.
-   As such it is a "base of trust", that also stores the keys you wish to
    protect.<br>
    But beware! By default keys generated on an HSM cannot leave the HSM.
-   Mostly used for: digital signing-validation and
    encryption-decryption.
-   Important in our line of work: make DNSsec RRSIGs using assymmetric encryption (using the private part of a key pair) .<br>
    Note: The counter part validation is not done on HSMs but on validating resolving nameservers.
-   Other usage:Â  signing SSL certificates, storing top level cert + key
    of a Certificate Authority, Code/Document signing, HTTPS/TLS
    operations.
-   Important to repeat: an HSM is (also) a key repository, it can create and
    delete keys and key-pairs if it receives the command to do so in the
    correct manner.
-   You can issue these command using a shell, a gui, or by using an
    programmatic interface/API.
-   Under the hood it probably all gets translated to some API or Socket
    call.
