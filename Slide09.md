## Why HSM?
Arguments for using an HSM:

-   **Trust & Safety**
    -   DNSsec and TLS/SSL rely heavily on web of trust!
    -   Safe key storage, Keys never leave the HSM. Keys are not in memory on your servers.
    -   Safe processing, crypto is done in the HSM.
    -   Can you afford to be the weakest link in a chain? Other people could be dependend on you?
-   **Certification** and transparancy can be factors here.
-   Interesting for **trusted (cloud)computing** (encrypted RAM for VM's in "half-trusted" environment)
-   When moving to the cloud: Possibly a way to **avoid breaking agreements**, maybe even avoid legal risks.
-   **Outsourcing**: the most cpu-intensive crypto processing to the most
    capable party "offloading"\
    Let your server focus on other stuff. An HSM could maybe handle tens
    of thousands of signatures per second
-   **HA and active-active** are very nice features, could have their own
    use cases.\
    E.g. a new key on HA-HSM1 will be propagated to HA-HSM2 as well Â 
-   **Easy audits**. No need to explain how you secure your keys, because
    the HSM does all this for you and auditors are familiar with them.
